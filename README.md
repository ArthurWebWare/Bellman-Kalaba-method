# Bellman-Kalaba-method

The Bellman-Kalaba method, also known as the shortest path algorithm, is one of the classical methods for solving the shortest path problem. It was developed in 1965 by Richard Bellman and Lester Ford Jr. This method is used to find the shortest paths from one vertex to all other vertices in a weighted directed graph, where edge weights can be both positive and negative.

Key ideas of the Bellman-Kalaba method:

1. **Iterative process:** The algorithm operates based on an iterative process, where each iteration updates the estimates of the shortest paths from the source vertex to all other vertices.

2. **Dynamic programming approach:** The Bellman-Kalaba algorithm utilizes a dynamic programming approach to find the shortest paths. It constructs the shortest paths incrementally, using information about shorter paths.

3. **Edge relaxation:** On each iteration, the algorithm performs edge relaxation to improve the current estimates of the shortest paths. Edge relaxation involves checking and, if possible, updating the shortest path estimate to a vertex reachable through a given edge.

4. **Number of iterations:** The number of iterations required to complete the algorithm depends on the number of vertices in the graph and its structure. Typically, N-1 iterations are needed, where N is the number of vertices, to guarantee finding the shortest paths from the source vertex to all others.

The Bellman-Kalaba method is widely used in various fields, including telecommunications, transportation logistics, artificial intelligence, and more. It is considered one of the fundamental algorithms in the fields of graph theory and optimization.
